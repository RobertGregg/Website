I'm a 4<sup>th</sup> year graduate student researcher in Chemical Engineering working under Dr. Jason Shoemaker in the [Immunosystems Lab](http://shoemakerlab.pitt.edu/). My research is focused on building multiscale mathematical models to understand how the innate immune system responds to disease. I’ve constructed models that investigate granuloma formation in tuberculosis, DNA detection in the cGAS pathway, and metabolic shifting during sepsis. I’ve always had a passion for teaching and mentoring at every skill level, from tutoring inner-city students in Rochester NY and performing chemistry “magic” shows for elementary school students, to leading my own calculus and differential equation courses for students entering college.
