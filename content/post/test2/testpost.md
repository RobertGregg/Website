Let's write an equation:
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
Academic comes with **automatic day (light) and night (dark) mode** built-in. Alternatively, visitors can  choose their preferred mode - click the sun/moon icon in the top right of the [Demo](https://academic-demo.netlify.com/) to see it in action! Day/night mode can also be disabled by the site admin in `params.toml`.
